// The file "O73siConj" contains 52 tuples each of which generates a distinct subgroup of E_8(3) in its adjoint representation isomorphic to Omega_7(3). 
// For j=1 to 52 the file "O73siAutGensj" contains a tuple of elements each of which generates a distinct subgroup of E_8(3) in its adjoint representation isomorphic to Aut(Omega_7(3)). 
// The file "O73Syl2sGConj" contains representatives for the (at most) eight G-conjugacy classes of Sylow 2-subgroups of possible subgroups isomorphic to Omega_7(3).
